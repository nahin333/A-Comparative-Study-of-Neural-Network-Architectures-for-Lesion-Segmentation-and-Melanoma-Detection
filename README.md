Deep learning applied with augmentation can save us from complex pre-processing steps and it studies the performance of different neural network architectures for lesion segmentation as an integral part of image processing-based techniques and finally evaluates network architectures for melanoma detection on dermoscopic images using transfer learning and presents a comparative view of those studies.
